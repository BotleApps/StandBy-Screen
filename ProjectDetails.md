## 1. Overview

The StandBy Screen web app is designed to serve as a pre-meeting display that informs users of an upcoming session. It provides a welcoming message, a dynamic countdown timer, and a rotating carousel of news items to keep users engaged until the meeting starts. The home page offers an overview of all configured standby screens and an interface to create and manage new ones.

## 2. Key Features and Functionality

### A. StandBy Screen Display

- **Welcome Message:**  
  A prominently displayed greeting (e.g., “Thank you for joining the session, please stay tuned!”) to engage users as soon as they view the screen.

  A large, easily readable timer showing the time left until the meeting begins.  
  - **Label:** A brief text label above or near the timer reading “We will start in.”

  Located in the lower half of the screen, the carousel rotates through news cards that provide additional context or updates.
  - **Card Elements:**
    - **Title:** Positioned at the top of the card.
    - **Content:** The body of the card can display text or an image.
    - **Footer:** Contains metadata such as a date and associated tags to categorize or highlight the news item.

## 3. Detailed UI/UX Design

### A. StandBy Screen Layout

- **Upper Half:**
  - **Welcome Message Area:**  
    Centrally positioned or aligned to draw immediate attention upon screen load.
  - **Countdown Timer:**  
    Displayed in a large font size for high visibility. The timer should have a contrasting background or color scheme to ensure legibility.

- **Lower Half:**
  - **Carousel:**
    - **Navigation:**  
      Consider automatic rotation with manual navigation controls (e.g., arrows or swipe gestures) for desktop and mobile users.
    - **Card Presentation:**  
      Cards should occupy full width within the carousel frame. Consistent styling (borders, shadows, spacing) enhances readability and visual appeal.

### B. Home Page Layout

- **Tiles/Grid View:**
  - Each tile represents a different StandBy Screen with a snapshot preview (e.g., name and a miniature version of the countdown/news layout).
  - **Interactivity:**  
    Tiles should be clickable, leading to a detailed view or edit mode for that particular screen.

- **Creation Flow:**
  - **Form Interface:**  
    A clean, intuitive form that collects:
    - StandBy Screen Name (text input)
    - Countdown Timer (input with validation for minutes and seconds)
    - Items (dynamic table or list where items can be added, edited, or removed)
  - **Submission:**  
    Once completed, the new screen is saved and immediately appears in the home page tiles.

## 4. User Flow

   - The form requires a screen name, countdown timer setting, and one or more news items.
   - Upon submission, the new screen is added to the grid.

3. **Activating a StandBy Screen:**
   - The user selects a tile from the home page.
   - The full StandBy Screen is launched, showing the welcome message, countdown timer, and news carousel.

## 5. Additional Considerations

- **Responsiveness:**  
  Ensure the design is responsive, so the interface works well on both desktops and mobile devices.

- **Accessibility:**  
  Use high-contrast colors for text and backgrounds. Ensure timer and news carousel elements are accessible via screen readers.

- **Customization:**  
  Consider allowing users to customize elements (e.g., change background images/colors or add additional content sections) in future versions.

- **Performance:**  
  Given the dynamic nature of the countdown and carousel, optimize performance to ensure smooth transitions and updates.
